     <p><strong>Open Source Design Workshop #1 in Tirana</strong></p>

<p>January 25, 2017 @ 5:00 pm - 8:00 pm</p>
     
     <p>To be a good designer you must use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop" target="blank">Adobe Photoshop</a> and/or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Illustrator" target="blank">Illustrator</a> right? Well, at Ura we believe that there are other, more open, ways to design. This is why, with your support from our <a href="https://www.patreon.com/ura" target="blank">Patreon campaign</a>, we are sharing our knowledge with young and established designers in a workshop dedicated to open source design.  During the event participants will learn about:</p>
     
     <ul>
     <li>the definition of open source design;</li>
     <li>the importance of working with open source tools;</li>
     <li>ways to use GIMP and Inkscape, two of the most used free open source design tools, in an effective and productive way;</li>
     <li>preparation of print-ready files using open source tools.</li>
     </ul>
     
     <p>Do not forget to take your laptop with you (and ideally a mouse).</p>
