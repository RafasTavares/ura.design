        <p>At Ura we have been gaining a lot from the Free Software & Open Source communities.<br />
          It might be almost cheesy, but we wouldn’t be here without the great support of various communities.</p>

<p>Having said that, we want to give back as well, so we are introducing Logobridge, a collection of unused logo proposals
over the past months and years, which are getting dusty already with no one using them.<br />
Use them as a placeholder for your project or as a template for your upcoming logo.</p>

<p>All logos are in the Public Domain, so you are free to do whatever you want with it (commercially as well).<br />
  They are also created with Inkscape, which is Free & Open Source Software.</br>
It’s a great way to kick off your open source project when you need to gather something quickly.</p>

     <p><strong>NEW LOGOS ADDED MONTHLY</strong></p>

<p>This project has been made possible by our kind supporters on Patreon. Become a patron and pledge so we can add more logos here!</p>
