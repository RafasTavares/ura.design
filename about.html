        <p>Ura is the open source design agency founded by a passionate team of open source contributors. Its name comes from the Albanian word Ura, which means bridge. We aim to connect innovative open source projects with accessible and people-centric design approaches.</p>
<p>We love Free & Open Source software! However we also believe that there is a lack of good design in many open source projects, which we want to change.</p>
<p>Good design can differentiate your open source project. Our logos are seen on dozens of open source projects from famous brands like Mozilla, Red Hat and Wikimedia. We have extensive experience working with open source projects, doing design, documentation, research and community building.</p>
